# Airbnb Seattle Data Analysis

**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listing activity in Seattle, leveraging datasets such as listings.csv, reviews.csv, and calendar.csv. By following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, the analysis delivers actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to optimize pricing, improve guest satisfaction, and manage availability effectively. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project:

## 1. Business Understanding

**Objective:**

Define the business questions and goals to guide the analysis.

**Key Questions:**

1. How can Airbnb hosts optimize their pricing strategy based on room type and property type?

2. What factors influence guest satisfaction, and how can hosts improve their ratings?

3. What are the trends in listing availability, and how can hosts manage their bookings more effectively?

**Deliverables:**

Clear definition of business objectives and questions to focus the analysis.



## 2. Data Understanding

**Objective:**
Explore and understand the datasets to identify patterns, trends, and data quality issues.

Steps:

1. Load datasets (listings.csv, reviews.csv, calendar.csv).

2. Perform initial exploration using .head(), .info(), and .describe().

3. Identify missing values, data types, and basic statistics.

4. Visualize data distributions (e.g., price, review scores, availability).

**Deliverables:**

Summary statistics and initial visualizations.

Identification of data quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers).

## 3. Prepare Data*

**Objective:**

Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.

**Steps:**

1. Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).

2. Convert categorical data into appropriate formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).

3. Clean price columns (e.g., remove '$' and convert to numeric).


**Deliverables:**
Cleaned and preprocessed datasets ready for analysis.

## 4. Evaluate the Results

**Objective:**
Interpret the results and validate insights against business questions.

Steps:

1. Summarize key findings from the analysis.

2. Validate insights against business questions.

3. Visualize results (e.g., correlation heatmaps, boxplots, word clouds).

4. Provide actionable recommendations for Airbnb hosts.


**Deliverables:**

- Final insights, visualizations, and recommendations.

**Usage**

1. Create the repository.
2. Place the datasets (listings.csv, reviews.csv, calendar.csv) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis and visualize the results.
